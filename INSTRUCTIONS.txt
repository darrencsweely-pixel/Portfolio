GITHUB PAGES QUICK START

1) Create a new repository named `portfolio` on GitHub.
   - Initialize with a README (you can replace it with the one in this zip).

2) Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Repo -> Settings -> Pages ->
   - Build and deployment: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` (root) -> Save
   - Your site will live at: https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/

3) Upload these files:
   - index.html
   - assets/style.css
   - README.md (optional but recommended)

4) Edit placeholders:
   - In index.html, update contact links and GitHub URLs.
   - Replace 'coming soon' repo links as you create projects.
   - Commit changes; Pages updates automatically in ~1-2 minutes.

5) Add a custom domain later (optional):
   - Buy a domain (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains)
   - In repo Settings -> Pages -> Custom domain
   - Add DNS A/ALIAS records to GitHub Pages as instructed.
