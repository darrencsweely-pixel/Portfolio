# Darren Sweely – Healthcare AI Security Portfolio

This repository hosts my public portfolio site, focused on **Healthcare AI Security** (Azure-first) with Epic EHR experience.

### Live site
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, it will be available at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`

### Structure
- `index.html` – main site
- `assets/style.css` – minimal styling
- Future: add `/projects/<project-name>` folders with READMEs, screenshots, and links to code repos.

### Roadmap
- Add first two projects:
  - HIPAA-Compliant Azure Data Storage Pipeline
  - Secure AI Clinical Decision Support Prototype
- Link repos after they’re created and pushed.
- Add blog posts to document design choices and compliance thinking.
